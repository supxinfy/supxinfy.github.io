# About

I’m Vladislav Shubin, a master's student in mathematics at Stockholm University. I’m interested in math, mainly number theory and algebra.



I would like to learn a lot about Langlands program, as I love L-function and modular forms.

Also, I have a bit of an interest in [Krawtchouk polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kravchuk_polynomials) and [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krawtchouk_matrices). I have some sort of bank of hypotheses and several solved problems there.


By the way, enjoy a picture of a Krawtchouk matrix.
{{<img caption="Krawtchouk matrix of order 409 modulo 41" alt="Krawtchouk matrix of order 409 modulo 41" class="main__image" src="41.jpg">}}

If you're hooked, there's a [repository](https://github.com/supxinfy/MWViewer) on Github where I'll collect some tools to visualize Krawtchouk matrices.

The [research section](#research-stuff) currently contains some published materials on the subjects mentioned.

In addition, I’m a [contributor](#oeis-contributions) to the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences).

Most of my contributions are involved with the problem of de Koninck. The problem lies mainly in elementary number theory.

Briefly, if we have a multiplicative function \\(\\mathrm{rad}(n)\\), which is equal to the product of distinct prime of integer \\(n\\), then when is it equal to another multiplicative function of \\(n\\)?

You can find my resume {{<link rellink="cv/cv.pdf" caption="here">}}.

Below, you can find some information from the resume.
