# About

I’m Vladislav Shubin, a master's student in mathematics at Stockholm University. I’m interested in math, mainly number theory and algebra.

My publications of any kind can be found {{<link rellink="texts" caption="here">}}.

## Interests

Some time I worked with [N. Gogin](https://www.mathnet.ru/php/person.phtml?option_lang=eng&personid=45587) on Krawtchouk matrices which were used in several interesting applications.

I have two repositories on Github related to this mathematical object: [MWViewer](https://github.com/supxinfy/MWViewer) (which I used on PCA2023), [krview](https://github.com/supxinfy/krview) (small program in Zig I made for fun).

In addition, I’m a [contributor](#oeis-contributions) to the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences).

Most of my contributions are involved with the problem of de Koninck. The problem lies mainly in analytical number theory.

You can find my resume {{<link rellink="cv/cv.pdf" caption="here">}}.
